### 9. **Marine Biology**  
**Problem**: Propose a sustainable method for cultivating edible seaweed in coastal areas as a food source and carbon sink.

- **Background**: Seaweed farming is gaining popularity as both a sustainable food source and a way to absorb excess carbon from the atmosphere. However, large-scale farming requires careful environmental management.
- **Importance**: Cultivating seaweed can provide nutritious food, support local economies, and help mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring the cultivation process does not harm local ecosystems, creating a viable market for seaweed products, and scaling operations without depleting coastal biodiversity.

---

### 10. **Tourism and Hospitality**  
**Problem**: Design an eco-friendly tourism model for remote natural reserves that minimizes environmental impact while boosting local economies.

- **Background**: Tourism in natural reserves often leads to environmental degradation due to infrastructure development and increased human activity. However, it remains a critical source of income for local communities.
- **Importance**: An eco-friendly model can preserve natural habitats while supporting economic growth, creating a balance between conservation and tourism.
- **Challenges**: Limiting the environmental footprint of tourism infrastructure, ensuring sustainable practices by visitors, and training local communities to manage and benefit from tourism responsibly.
